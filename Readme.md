# Uni Calendar iOS App

This readme provides an overview of the iOS app and its features. The app is designed to manage events, display a calendar, and provide a class schedule feature. Read on to learn more about each tab and its functionalities.

## Start Tab View
The app consists of three main tabs accessible from the Start Tab View.

### List Tab
The List Tab displays a list of events. Events can be added, edited, or deleted using this tab. Any changes made to an event in the List Tab will be automatically reflected in the Calendar Tab.
